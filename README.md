# WKMN Attribution for Websites

For free-tier websites, `WKMN.js` is automatically injected into their primary layout. To ensure a less conspicuous attribution, the script recognizes an anchor tag with specific attributes: `href`, `target`, `data-wkmn`, and `id`.

```html
Designed & Developed by <a href="https://www.wkmn.dev/" target="_blank" id="wkmn-att" data-wkmn="true">WKMN Development</a>
```
If you prefer to remove the WKMN Development button from the lower right corner of your website, you have two options:

1. Upgrade to a paid plan.
2. Add a custom WKMN Attribution somewhere in your footer, similar to the example above.
